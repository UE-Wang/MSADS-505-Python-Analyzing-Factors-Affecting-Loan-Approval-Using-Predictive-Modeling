## Overview

The main purpose of this project was to use data science to make intelligent business decisions based on a Kaggle data set. Data mining models were created to predict if a loan applicant should be approved or rejected based on theirnumber of dependents, education level, emplyment status, annual income, requested loan amount, requested loan term, cibil score (FICO score), and monetary assets. The following models were created during this project:

The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.

The Decision Tree model demonstrates excellent performance with a high accuracy of 97.84% on the validation set, alongside impressive precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. It maintains strong generalization capabilities, and the negative AIC value suggests a solid model fit. These results indicate that the Decision Tree is both effective and reliable for our project. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned to balance between depth and simplicity to avoid overfitting, ensuring consistent and dependable performance across diverse datasets.
